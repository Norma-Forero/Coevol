Identifying coevolutive hostpot of pathogens will prevent the spread of deadly pathogens. 
Using the coevolutionary hipothesis proposed by Thompson, we will explain the evolutve mechanism behind virulence diversity ( refering to virulence the amount and the speed of which a pathogen kill a host )
- [ ] sentence what virulence is for coevolution, virulence for host or for human


Successful public health strategies for mitigating emerging infectious disease, requires understand evolutve history from the interaction between pathogens with their host under a geographical frame.


and inmune adaptation at a biogeographical scale. Aditional to suggest methods to identifiy hotspots and coldspots of coevolution with potential higher risk of cross species transmission (?). 
- [ ] Tell a story :  Coevolution is the reciprocal adaptation among interacting organisms, and one of the teories that better explain biodiversity because coevolutionary selection can lead to speciation. Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution examines and compare local variation in species interactions from diferent geographical points to approaching a method to measure coevolution.
A geographic mosaic of coevolution (GMC) occurs when local variation in species interactions produces a spatially variable pattern of reciprocal adaptation in these species (REF)


**Coevolution of pathogen- host interaction**

*Geographic mosaic for pathogen host coevolution*

From the interaction between two species, different types of traits can result that coincide with co-evolution, as antogonistic interactions like pathogen host interaction. Pathogens have a negative effect on host fitness, favouring selection of enhanced defence mechanisms in the affected hosts. If pathogen fitness depends on the host, then host defence can be detrimental for the pathogen, leading to selection for novel attack mechanisms. When the interaction persists over time, the ongoing cycles of adaptation and counteradaptation can produce one of the highest selective pressures known in nature(REF) Pathogen- host coevolution :  pathogens can respond in a variety of ways, and there have been several conceptual models (gene for gene, matching alleles, red queen, fluctuating selection dynamics, ...)

- [ ] Virulence evolution  : Virulence is defined as the capacity of a pathogen of decrease the fitness of the host, but for several models have been adresses as the death rate once it is infected [[Cressler2016AdaEvo]]  ;  [[Frank2008MecPat]]. The understanding of virulence and how we measure it has been approached mostly using modelling. Highly specialized with high virulence or generalist with low virulence.

- [ ] Infection cycles occur at a geografical scale, influenced with external factors : Small paragraph from: Carlson 2022 Climate change

- [] Hotspot and Coldspot breifly explanation paragraph ; Coevolutionary cold spots arise for many reasons, including nonoverlapping geographic ranges (Nuismer et al., 2003), the presence or absence of additional species (Benkman et al., 2001) or shifting abiotic conditions (Hochberg and van Baalen, 1998).

**Do we need to Identify hotspots of pathogen-host coevolution?**

- [ ] Recognizing transmission cyle and how to be part of it. (So we can avoid them? ) What does a hotspot look like?
Take-home message: Hotspot areas we can find pathogens that can be highly virulent, and not necessary specialized.  Recognizing to avoid being part of it (If we detect hotspots, we can know how they influence other areas and therefore avoid or mitigate their impact) 

- [ ] We dont want to be part of a hotspot , we want to live in coldspots with generalist pathogens.
Hotspots have highly specialized pathogen - host interactions, the participation of new host to those transmission cycle can be letal for the recently include specie.  Generalist or be a specialist.

- [ ]  Cross species transmission: We want to eradicate pathogens that have an impact on the quality of life of our host of interest, in this case humans. We also have pathogens that we are not interested in eradicating because they are imperceptible in their impact on health, or the global economy.  We have succeeded in eradicating micro-organisms specialising in a single host. The importance of identifying pathogens that are specialised but easily move to another species or those that are generalists but are also detrimental to the wellbeing of the individual they infect is of paramount importance.

- [ ] It's not only about hotspot, it's also about how it interact with cold spot  : As hotspots influence coldspots, while maladaptation may exist, these pathogens are not able to infect anything. It can also happen that these pathogens are very virulent (after being in the red queen theory with other hosts) and therefore, once they pass to a new host, they are lethal.

**How we identify and meausre a coevolutive hotspot?**
It has been proposed some methods to approach coevolution in nature  - [ ] [[Woolhouse2002Biomedicalcoevolution ]]  [[Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon]] debate
- [ ] Betacov methods 
The identification of coevolutive pathogen-host areas requires evidence of change… - *Awesome methods?*
But we still face some challenges like 
- Gene flow can also be a creative force, providing genetic variation for reciprocal selection and continued coadaptation under antagonistic coevolution, theoretical studies show that, provided migration rates are low, the species with the relatively greater amount of gene flow will generally show adaptation, rather than maladaptation [@Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon] (Gandon et al., 1996; Gandon, 2002). Several empirical studies of hosts and parasites have examined local adaptation and relative gene flow and support this theoretical result (reviewed in Dybdahl and Storfer, 2003) (REF) . Whether gene flow is an important source of trait remixing depends on the relative geographic scales and strength of selection mosaics compared to gene flow (gene passage through different patches)

*how to quantify a hotspot *
From fieldwork to modelling perpective? 
*Ok, How can we identify it:* Probably, the most direct way to detect a selection mosaic empirically is to carefully replicate genotype frequencies in all species across different localities. @Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon

Do use regression approaches, selective source analysis and multivariate approaches to infer hot spots. When looking to establish cold spots for a particular interaction, don’t forget to include regions where one of the species is completely absent.@Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon (?)


However, measuring coevolution requires [ ] *Methods?* . Cevolutionary process between pathogen - host can regulate the pathogens virulence according to its  specialization to the inmune sytem of the host, despite how promising seems using GMTC with epidemiological porpuses. Its implementation is still challenging for the local and spatial criteria that frequently are both hard to find and measure.
