Successful public health strategies for mitigating emerging infectious disease, requires understand evolutve history from the interaction between pathogens with their host under a geographical frame.  Using the coevolutionary hipothesis proposed by Thompson , will lead us to explain the evolutve mechanism behind virulence diversity ( refering to virulence the amount and the speed of which a pathogen kill a host ) and inmune adaptation in a biogeographical scale. Coevolution is the reciprocal adaptation among interacting organisms, and one of the teories that better explain biodiversity because coevolutionary selection can lead to speciation. Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution examines geographic variation in species interactions to approaching a method to measure coevolution.

However,A geographic mosaic of coevolution (GMC) occurs when local
variation in species interactions produces a spatially variable
pattern of reciprocal adaptation in these species
Measuring coevolution is difficult because it involves
determining how two species interact through time, and without a time machine it is difficult to measure how traits of
interacting species have changed through time. The difficulties
in rigorously testing coevolutionary hypotheses led to questions
about its importance as an evolutionary force. To solve the
problems in testing the coevolutionary hypothesis, Thompson
(1999, 2005) developed the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution that examines geographic variation in species interactions to use space as a proxy for time to measure coevolution.
A geographic mosaic of coevolution (GMC) occurs when local

pattern of reciprocal adaptation in these species

Measuring factors as local adaptation, tranfering some genes, biogeografical evidence. 
Acordingly, we propose  *methods* to measure pathogen - host coevolution, trying to encompass the complexity of coevolution. 

Local coevolutionary process between pathogen - host can regulate the pathogens virulence according to its  specialization to the inmune sytem of the host, despite how promising seems using GMTC with epidemiological porpuses. Its implementation is still challenging, considering that coevolution implies rules as properly measuring  coevolution, based on local and spatial criteria that frequently are both hard to find and measure. 

**Coevolution of pathogen- host interaction**

*Geographic mosaic for pathogen host coevolution*

pathogens have a negative effect on host fitness, favouring selection of enhanced defence mechanisms in the affected hosts. If pathogen fitness depends on the host, then host defence can be detrimental for the pathogen, leading to selection for novel attack mechanisms. When the interaction persists over time, the ongoing cycles of adaptation and counteradaptation can produce one of the highest selective pressures known in nature(REF) Pathogen- host coevolution :  pathogens can respond in a variety of ways, and there have been several conceptual models (gene for gene, matching alleles, red queen, fluctuating selection dynamics, ...)

- [ ] Virulence evolution  : Virulence is defined as the capacity of a pathogen of decrease the fitness of the host, but for several models have been adresses as the death rate once it is infected [[Cressler2016AdaEvo]]  ;  [[Frank2008MecPat]]. The understanding of virulence and how we measure it has been approached mostly using modelling. Highly specialized with high virulence or generalist with low virulence. 
- [ ] Inmune system : How the inmune system adapt to pathogens. Evo. 
- [ ] Infection cycles occur at a geografical scale, influenced with external factors : Small paragraph from: Carlson 2022 Climate change (REF : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04788-w ) , (...) 

GMTC describe how co evolution it a reciprocal evolutionary change that occurs between interacting groups [REF] but under a geographical framework (ref). 



Coevolutionary cold spots arise for many reasons, including nonoverlapping geographic ranges (Nuismer et al., 2003), the presence or absence of additional species (Benkman et al., 2001) or shifting abiotic conditions (Hochberg and van Baalen, 1998).

**Do we need to Identify hotspots of pathogen-host coevolution?**

- [ ] Recognize transmission cyle and how to be part of it. (So we can avoid them)
(Cuando hablamos de coevolucion pathogeno - huesped. Como se ve eso en la naturaleza de acuerdo a Thompson) 1. Como se ve un hotspot : Un hotspot, de acuerdo a thompson, teoricamente lo podriamos identificar si - Insertar lo que dice G sobre identficar estas areas-  

Take-home message: Hotspot areas we can find pathogens that can be highly virulent, and not necessary specialized.  Recognizing to avoid being part of it (If we detect hotspots, we can know how they influence other areas and therefore avoid or mitigate their impact) 

- [ ] We dont want to be part of a hotspot , we want to live in coldspots with generalist pathogens.
Hotspots have highly specialized pathogen - host interactions, the participation of new host to those transmission cycle can be letal for the recently include specie.  Generalist or be a specialist.

- [ ]  Cross species transmission: We want to eradicate pathogens that have an impact on the quality of life of our host of interest, in this case humans. We also have pathogens that we are not interested in eradicating because they are imperceptible in their impact on health, or the global economy.  We have succeeded in eradicating micro-organisms specialising in a single host. The importance of identifying pathogens that are specialised but easily move to another species or those that are generalists but are also detrimental to the wellbeing of the individual they infect is of paramount importance.

- [ ] It's not only about hotspot, it's also about how it interact with cold spot : 3. As hotspots influence coldspots, while maladaptation may exist, these pathogens are not able to infect anything. It can also happen that these pathogens are very virulent (after being in the red queen theory with other hosts) and therefore, once they pass to a new host, they are lethal.

**How we identify and meausre a coevolutive hotspot?**
It has been proposed some methods to approach coevolution in nature  - [ ] [[Woolhouse2002Biomedicalcoevolution ]]  [[Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon]] debate
- [ ] Betacov methods 
The identification of coevolutive pathogen-host areas requires evidence of change… - *Awesome methods?*
But we still face some challenges like 
- Gene flow can also be a creative force, providing genetic variation for reciprocal selection and continued coadaptation under antagonistic coevolution, theoretical studies show that, provided migration rates are low, the species with the relatively greater amount of gene flow will generally show adaptation, rather than maladaptation [@Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon] (Gandon et al., 1996; Gandon, 2002). Several empirical studies of hosts and parasites have examined local adaptation and relative gene flow and support this theoretical result (reviewed in Dybdahl and Storfer, 2003) (REF) . Whether gene flow is an important source of trait remixing depends on the relative geographic scales and strength of selection mosaics compared to gene flow (gene passage through different patches)

*how to quantify a hotspot *
From a field vs modelling perpective? 
*Ok, How can we identify it:* Probably, the most direct way to detect a selection mosaic empirically is to carefully replicate genotype frequencies in all species across different localities. @Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon

Este autor propone que : To sum up, our dos and don’ts for evaluating hot and cold spots are: do use regression approaches, selective source analysis and multivariate approaches to infer hot spots. When looking to establish cold spots for a particular interaction, don’t forget to include regions where one of the species is completely absent.@Gomulkiewicz2007DosDon
